LAST UPDATE: 7/22/2011

This is the Eve Danza injection suite. Over time, I will update the included scripts and the injector. Thanks to Wibiti for the injector and other help!

The current scripts and their features:

ProbeHelperSE:
- Improved upon the original ProbeHelper by wibiti
- Averaging results on multiple selections (instead of going to the first)
- Save/load probe positions; shift click to save result location, and control click to save current probe position, left-click to send probes to the saved location
- Listing of ship types as soon as possible for combat scanner (hidden by default)
- Send probes to active item
*
- WatchWarpOff: shift-click to start watching balls; left-click again to remove nonexistant code
- GetNearbyItem: when watching warpoff, returns the item that is closest to the current active item
- Hostile count: a counter for hostiles in local (all nonfriendly); clicking to report detailed counts

Dscanner:
- Added slider to adjust d-scan range (from 1AU to 14.4AU, in .5 steps)
- Distance approximation; the script will save the last max distance for any given result, so that after scanning at various ranges the results have their distance approximated
- Display of itemID in parenthesese behind item name


TO-DO:

- All-in-one injection

ProbeHelperSE:
- Save/load ignorelist
- Alternative scanning mode using 2 sets of 4 probes

Dscanner:
- One-click celestial conescan

Injector:
- GUI support
- Automated injection
